# Understanding and Using RAG

## Repository for Generative AI RAG hands-on workshop ##

These instructions will guide you through configuring a GitHub Codespaces environment that you can use to do the labs. 

<br><br>

**1. Change your codespace's default timeout from 30 minutes to longer (60 suggested).**
To do this, when logged in to GitHub, go to https://github.com/settings/codespaces and scroll down on that page until you see the *Default idle timeout* section. Adjust the value as desired.

**3. Then click on the option to create a new codespace.**

**This will run for a long time while it gets everything ready.**

After the initial startup, it will run a script to setup the python environment and install needed python pieces. This will take several more minutes to run. It will look like this while this is running.

The codespace is ready to use when you see a prompt like the one shown below in its terminal.

**4. Open up the *labs.md* file so you can follow along with the labs.**
You can either open it in a separate browser instance or open it in the codespace. If you open it in the codespace, make sure to *Open Preview* so you can see it in Markdown form as intended.
